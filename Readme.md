# Punch

A time tracking cli which doesn't do much
( beyond my immediate needs )

## Usage

```bash
# start the time
punch in <some task name>

# end the current task
punch out

# list the current times
punch list [--name STRING] [--days INT]

# total unbilled times in hours
punch total [--name STRING] [--days INT]
```


## Install

```
stack install
```
